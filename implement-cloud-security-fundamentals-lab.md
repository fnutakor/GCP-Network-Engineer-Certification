Implement Cloud Security Fundamentals on Google Cloud Challenge Lab
This guide provides a solution for the "Implement Cloud Security Fundamentals on Google Cloud" Challenge Lab. The goal is to deploy and secure a Kubernetes Engine private cluster according to specific security standards.

Challenge Scenario
As a junior member of the security team at Jooli Inc., you are tasked with deploying, configuring, and testing a new Kubernetes Engine cluster that complies with the organization's security standards. This includes:

Deploying the cluster using a dedicated service account with the least privileges.
Creating the cluster as a Kubernetes Engine private cluster with no public endpoint.
Restricting access to the cluster master to a specific IP address (Orca group's management jumphost).
Binding specific IAM roles to the service account and creating a custom role for Google Cloud Storage access.
Solution Outline
The solution involves several key steps:

Set up environment variables.
Create and bind a service account with minimal required permissions.
Deploy the Kubernetes Engine private cluster.
Verify the deployment and security settings.
Step-by-Step Commands
1. Set Up Environment Variables
First, set up your environment variables in CloudShell. Replace placeholders with actual values:

bash
Copy code
export CUSTOM_ROLE="GCSObjectManager"
export S_A="orca-k8s-sa"
export CLUSTER="orca-private-cluster"
export ZONE="us-central1-a"
2. Download and Run the Automation Script

Creates a Service Account:
The script creates a service account named orca-k8s-sa in your Google Cloud project.

Assigns IAM Roles:
It binds the necessary IAM roles to the service account:

roles/monitoring.viewer
roles/monitoring.metricWriter
roles/logging.logWriter
Additionally, it creates and binds a custom role (GCSObjectManager) to allow the service account to manage Google Cloud Storage objects.

Deploys the Kubernetes Engine Private Cluster:
The script then deploys a private Kubernetes cluster using the service account with the specified configuration:

Private cluster with no public endpoint.
Restricts master access to the IP address of the Orca management jumphost.
Verifies the Cluster Configuration:
After deployment, the script checks if the cluster is set up correctly and if the security settings are enforced.

4. Diagram
Below is a conceptual diagram of the Kubernetes Engine private cluster setup. It illustrates the secure deployment with restricted access via the Orca management jumphost and private nodes with no public endpoint.


5. Testing and Verification
Finally, verify the deployment by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER --zone $ZONE

kubectl get nodes
Deploy a simple test application to ensure the cluster is functioning as expected:

bash
Copy code
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
Ensure the public endpoint is inaccessible and only the specified IP address can reach the cluster master.

Conclusion
This solution demonstrates how to securely deploy a Kubernetes Engine private cluster in Google Cloud by following the security standards of Jooli Inc. The automated script simplifies the process, ensuring that the cluster is configured with the least privilege and restricted access.
